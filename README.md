# Facial_Tracking

This project was my attempt to learn and utilize the cv2 library. In addition to familiarizing myself with the library, I was interested in emulating a snapchat-like filter which ran in real time. Using cv2, I was able to utilize the haar cascade network to segment faces in real time and add certain objects into the frame.
